# Final Project

**Suicide Rates**
- Our project will be investigating suicide rates globally in comparison to mental health facilities offered, and the socioeconomic status of each country. Suicide has become more widely talked about in social media in recent years, however it seems the awareness of mental health has been an emerging topic in developed countries but is not as emphasized in undeveloped countries. Suicide has resulted in the loss of many amazing people. As such, we want to investigate possible correlations between these different indicators, hopefully determining a reason or a trend for higher suicide rates in particular countries over others.

**Other projects related to this domain:**
- [Suicide Rate By Country 2020](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/suicide-rate-by-country/)
>- This project investigates suicide rates in each country, providing one map visualization. It focuses on particular countries of note (South Korea, Japan, Switzerland and China) and provides a more detailed background on suicide (particular historical and demographic trends) as well as the political and legal issues pertaining to suicide in those countries.
- [World Suicide Data Visualization with Tableau](https://medium.com/@lulu.ilmaknun.q/world-suicide-data-visualization-with-tableau-4464b68883f5)
>- This project focuses on certain trends in suicide rates based on demographics, such as age, race, gender and generation. As it is mainly displaying the capabilities of Tableau, the analysis is mainly graph-based.
- [Suicide - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/suicide)
>- This project investigates changes in suicide rates throughout the years, the global and demographic distribution of those rates, the breakdown of methods used to commit suicide, and possible risk factors for suicide. Multiple charts are provided to clearly display the distribution in each section being investigated.

**Questions we hope to answer:**
- Is there a correlation between a country’s socioeconomic status and its suicide rate?
>- Using data from ..., we can directly compare a country's socioeconomic status with it's suicide rate.
- Are there more mental health facilities for countries with higher suicide rates? Or is the number affected by socioeconomic status?
>- 
- How does age and gender relate to the number of suicide rates? IS there a higher rate for a particular demographic?
>- 
`Describes how the question can be answered using data (e.g., a specific comparison within or analysis of the data that answers the question) (1 point)`
>- How do different countries’ suicide rates change over time? Are they similar or drastically different, and if different, why so?

>- There are 5785 observations/rows (each row showcases a country’s suicide rate within a certain year (per 100,000 people)
>-There are 8 features/columns in this data
>- _How do different countries’ suicide rates change over time? Are they similar or drastically different, and if different, why so?_
