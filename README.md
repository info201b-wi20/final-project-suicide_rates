# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

Why are we interested in Suicide Rates?
- To investigate possible correlations between a country’s socioeconomic status and its suicide rate. Awareness of mental health has been an emerging topic in developed countries but is not as emphasized in undeveloped countries.

Questions we hope to answer:

- Common cause?
- Age and gender?
