# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

Why are we interested in Suicide Rates?
- To investigate possible correlations between a country’s socioeconomic status and its suicide rate. Awareness of mental health has been an emerging topic in developed countries but is not as emphasized in undeveloped countries. `FIX`

Questions we hope to answer:
- Is there a correlation between a country’s socioeconomic status and its suicide rate?
- Common cause?
- Age and gender?
